# Advent of Code 2021, in Go

Source: https://adventofcode.com/2021/

All fifty stars acquired!

## TODO

- Implement Github Action to build, test and get badges
- Refactor day 23 because it is the worst thing I have ever done and it takes forever to run
- Actually day 24 is worse so also refactor this one
- Day 25 should be optimized
