# Advent of Code 2021, in Go

Source: https://adventofcode.com/2021/

All fifty stars acquired!

## TODO

- Implement Github Action to build, test and get badges
- Day 23: Use A* instead of Dijkstra, or something more appropriate (it takes a very long time)/
- Day 24: I could get how the "pop" operations occurred and reduce the number of operations to make but I should really
dive into the "push" operations to work out how the program behaves.
- Day 25: could be optimized.
