# Advent of Code 2021, in Go

Source: https://adventofcode.com/2021/

## TODO

- Refactor project layout (see https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) 
- Check private / public identifiers (see https://yourbasic.org/golang/public-private/)
- Implement Github Action to build, test and get badges
- Refactor day 23 because it is the worst thing I have ever done and it takes forever to run
- Actually day 24 is worse so also refactor this one
